### Custom Frames and Faces
When modeling the face, be sure to face it in the direction of the up vector in Unreal Engine. Only one face model is required since it will be duplicated inside UE.
The frame can be modeled in any way, just make sure it's a single whole piece that can accommodate all six faces.
